############################ General configuration ############################

# Turn on/off automatic start.
# ignore this on Gentoo
# Note: this tells the init script not to start pgl on "start".
# The same behaviour can be achieved by removing/tweaking the init file and the
# links pointing to it. You can do this manually or by using an application such
# as rcconf.
# 0 - Don't start pgl at system boot
# 1 - Start pgl at system boot
INIT="1"

# Turn on/off automatic blocklist update.
# 0 - Don't update the blocklists automatically
# 1 - Update the blocklists automatically
CRON="1"

# Turn on/off pglcmd.wd.
# 0 - Don't use watchdog
# 1 - Start watchdog
WD="1"

# Set the interval in seconds in which pglcmd.wd checks if the blocking works.
# Don't choose a too low value! Or the watchdog will think the daemon is not
# working, although the daemon is just still busy with loading the blocklist
# after a start.
WD_SLEEP="300"

# Set the nice level the watchdog is started with. Valid values are between -20
# and 19. Higher values make the watchdog more friendly to other applications.
# Note: This variable is applied by the LSB init functions. pglcmd's builtin and
# Debian's functions use the nicelevel, but Redhat's use the adjustment of the
# nicelevel (since the default nice level is 0, this normally has the same
# effect. More important, Redhat's functions require to specify a "+" for
# positive values, while this can be omitted for the internal and Debian's.
# See nice(1) and renice(1).
WD_NICE="+19"

# Set the nice level the daemon is started with. Valid values are between -20
# and 19. Higher values make the daemon more friendly to other applications, but
# might have drawbacks on its own functionality.
# See the note on WD_NICE above.
NICE_LEVEL="+0"

# You may specify additional options for wget for the blocklist download here.
# Note: In this variable the download application (wget) must be contained! Some
# options are hardcoded in pglcmd.lib and so are not changeable here.
# The default options make sure that pglcmd plays nice with the list
# servers.
# For example you may specify a proxy:
# WGET_OPTS="env http_proxy=URL wget -q -t 5 -T 120 -w 5 --user-agent=${CMD_NAME}/${VERSION}"
WGET_OPTS="wget -q -t 5 -T 120 -w 5 --user-agent=${CMD_NAME}/${VERSION}"

# Try to download this site before blocklist updates.
# If this fails, pglcmd assumes that there is no network available, and thus
# aborts the update. The default configured site is also used to determine the
# user friendly blocklist names for iblocklist.com URLs.

#     These activation iptables rules are inserted at the head of the chains
#     INPUT, OUTPUT and FORWARD. Checking all (not only NEW) traffic might cause
#     problems, because pgld has to check much more traffic then.

################################ Whitelist IPs ################################

# Possibility 1:
# You can specify IP ranges that shall not be checked by pgl in a separate file.
# Per default this is /etc/pgl/allow.p2p. Change the ALLOW_[IN|OUT|FWD]
# variables if you want to use different allow lists for incoming, outgoing and
# forwarded traffic.
# DEPRECATION WARNING: This will be changed to use the same allow list for all
# directions. The underlying technical change is that currently the IP ranges
# from the allow lists get whitelisting iptables rules, but the planned new
# implementation is that these IP ranges get removed from the blocklist.

# Possibility 2:
# Whitelist IPs (traffic from/to these IPs will not be checked)
# Valid values: plain IPs or network IP addresses (with /mask). The mask can
# be either a network mask or a plain number, specifying the number of 1's at
# the left side of the network  mask. Thus, a mask of 24 is equivalent to
# 255.255.255.0.
# Separate several entries with whitespace (" ")
# Technical implementation: iptables rules in the corresponding iptables chains,
# matching --source/destination IP, target IPTABLES_TARGET_WHITELISTING.

# Do a "pglcmd restart" when you have changed these settings.

###################### Remove lines from the blocklist ########################

# Remove lines from the blocklist matching the specified pattern (the search
# pattern is case-insensitive).
# Separate patterns with a semicolon ";". Be careful: senseless values are also
# accepted.
# Warning for beginners: If you want to whitelist a special IP then use the
# allowlist. If you specify an IP here you will most likely fail.
#
# Do a "pglcmd reload" when you have changed these settings.

# "" (empty string): no rule will be inserted
# "LOG --log-level info": blocked packets will be logged to syslog with "info"
#     log level. This allows to verify if a packet is really blocked and not
#     just "marked block".
